The research of the way of formalization and representation of meaning contained in texts and speech in natural language.<br><br>
"In recent years, indeed, the existence and importance of this problem of Meaning have been generally admitted, but by some sad chance those who have attempted a solution have too often been forced to relinquish their ambition - whether through old age, like Leibnitz, or penury, like C. S. Peirce, or both. Even the methods by which it is to be attacked have remained in doubt." (C.K. Ogden, "The Meaning of Meaning")<br><br>
