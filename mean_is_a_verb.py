'mind'. The underlying meaning is a verb representing the _process_ of thinking something over, represented in our contemporary English by the verb*s* 'mean' and 'mind'.
In this sense the proverbial 'meaning' is just a process of thinking something over some experience, including the process of thinking over the words that were percieved and the result of this effort of thought - understanding (as a noun).
